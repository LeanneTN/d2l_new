This directory is for the book named Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem. The book is written by Abhishek Thakur, who is a Kaggle Grandmaster and a Data Scientist at Microsoft. The book is a good reference for me to learn how to solve a machine learning problem.
I will implement so code in it, mainly focus to when and how to use the machine learning models.
